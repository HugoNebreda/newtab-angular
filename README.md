#Briefly
Developed for personal use after changing from chrome to firefox.
Inspired by Momentum addon for Google Chrome.

#Features/Tech
Daily changing background, quote and a forecast (openweathermap.org/api), data is cached to html5 localStorage and expires daily/hourly (forecast).
There is no setup so feel free to tweak around to make it suitable for your needs. The "app" is powered by AngularJs, RequireJs and momentum.js (datetime localization).
